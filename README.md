# Tic-tac-toe

## The second project for The Odin Project's Full Stack Javascript path.

The objective is to make a tic-tac-toe game to practice using factory functions and module patterns.

TODO:

- Add a validation so player's can't have an empty name.
- Maybe a form in a modal to enter the names.
- Maybe refactor the gameboard module into two modules.
